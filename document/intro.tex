The IObundle Timer core includes a 64-bit counter for returning the time in
clock cycles. It is written in Verilog and includes a C software driver. With
the knowledge of the clock frequency in its software driver, it is also possible
to print the time in microseconds, milliseconds or seconds.  The IP is currently
supported for use in ASICs and FPGAs.
